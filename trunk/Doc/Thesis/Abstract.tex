\chapter{Abstract}
This thesis is part of the field in computer graphics that deals with
physically based animation. Physically based animation deals with the movement
of particles and rigid bodies according to the laws of physics. It is not
concerned with the lighting and rendering of these bodies. A method for implementing
a dynamics system is described using Newtonian mechanics. An alternative approach
studied was Lagrangian dynamics, however it was found that Newtonian mechanics
were sufficient for our purposes. The accuracy of the implementation was verified by
various methods. A physical model of a hexapod was put together. This
involved an investigation into control.
