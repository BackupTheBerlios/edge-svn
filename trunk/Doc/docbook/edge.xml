    <para>
      The Edge library can be used to simulate the motion of rigid bodies and render
      them in real time. It's something I work on in my spare time and I hope it will
      evolve into something better.

      <title>Differential Equation Solvers</title>

    <para>
      A differential equation solver is used to numerically solve a differential
      system. Imagine a particle where the velocity and force on the particle at
      a given time is know. Using this information and a differential equation
      solver we can work out the position of the particle at the next time step.
      Currently the library implements an Euler solver and an RK4 solver.
